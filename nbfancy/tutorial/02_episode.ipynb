While you can fork the repository if you want to contribute to the template tutorial or build system, we recommend that you duplicate the repository to your own account (for each lesson you create.  Once you have cloned you can copy (mirror) the repository to create a [duplicate](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) where you can develop your tutorial."

Take care when editing to close notebooks when adding, committing to a repository and particularly (if using them) when you switch between branches.**  More detail on the different notebook files is given in the next episode.\n",
