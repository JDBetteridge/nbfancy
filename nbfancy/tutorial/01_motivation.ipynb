    "## The current method\n",
    "In our experience the development of training material, tutorials and lessons for programming can be fairly ad-hoc. The process usually goes something like this:\n",
    "1. Start a document in your text editor/word processor of choice\n",
    "2. While (not finished):\n",
    "    1. Write some narrative\n",
    "    2. Write some _perfect_ example code in a seperate text editor/IDE/terminal\n",

    "Of course this assumes a perfect world where eveything works first time. The ususal story is by the time we start working on the second example, we notice a mistake in the first example, or something else that is needed, oar a better way of writing it. At this stage we need to go back to our code, edit it, check it runs and then copy and past both the input and output to our document again.\n",

    "One answer to mixing code with the text of training material is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org). This platform allows a user to write the narrative in markdown, a very simple markup language with basic formatting and simultaneously write code, execute it and see the output all in the same document. It is for this reason that we use notebooks as the basis for NBfancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, notebooks are not perfect. As unpopular an opinion as this may be, using notebooks can lead to all kinds of problems. A lot of information in a notebook is stored in a hidden state, out of order execution can cause problems and workarounds often lead to bad practise. It's not that we don't like notebooks, we just think they can be better!"
