    "Of course this assumes the perfect world where eveything works first time. The ususal story is by the time we start working on the second example, we notice a mistake in the first example, or something else that is needed, or a better way of writing it. At this stage we need to go back stage 2 and typically several iterations are required.  This process is time consuming, reduces the time we invest in the content and means, even minor changes can take significant effort and creating new material.  Likely, if you are in this position, you just find someone elses material and hope that it fits your needs."

The narrative is in markdown, a lightweight markup language with basic formatting.  An ever increasing number of programming languagues are supported, with code executed and output viewed all in the same document. It is for this reason that we use notebooks as the basis for NBfancy.\n",

    "However, notebooks are not perfect. As unpopular an opinion as this may be, using notebooks can lead to all kinds of problems. A lot of information in a notebook is stored in a hidden state, out of order execution can cause problems and workarounds often lead to bad practise. It's not that we don't like notebooks, we just think they can be better!"
