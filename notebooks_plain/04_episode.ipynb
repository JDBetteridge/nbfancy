    "    In addition to the episodes a number of files are used to provide a consistent format (branding) for the lesson.  Key in these are `top.ipynb` and `bottom.ipynb`, currently found in the `tools` directory.  Unfortunately we have not yet identified tno to avoid users having to use `html` at this stage.  It is probably worth explaining here that while `markdown` is in its plain form a stripped back human readable mark-up language, it is apparently a superset of `html`, meaning that all valid `html` is also valid `markdown`.  The key words we have used decorate cells with `html` when the rendered notebooks are created."
